# Transformer-based long-range wave functions

This repository contains the software required to reproduce the results shown in

_Transformer Wave Function for Quantum Long-Range models_

where the use of the Visual Transformer (ViT) as variational ansatz to obtain
ground states of quantum long-range spin-1/2 models is explored.
